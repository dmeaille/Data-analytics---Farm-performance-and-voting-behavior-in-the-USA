# Description : 
# 
# This file creates the data set for electoral turnout.
# It uses ICPSR-08611 data as input, and the files Correspondence.csv and StateFIPSicsprAB.xls 
# to create an unique FIPS identifier that matches each State and Counties. 
# It produces Election_Data_Democrats.csv as output.

# We want to convert the ICPSR Codes to FIPS codes to match our agricultural data.
# In the Codebook of electoral data, we can observe that a general rule that seems 
# to apply states that we need to divide the ICPSR county code by then to retrieve 
# the corresponding FIPS County Code.
# However, there is a short problem : some ICPSR are not multiples of 10

# We might have to get rid of them to continu our task.
# So let's check what type of location they pertain to.
# We can see that they are not very relevant : tulalip res washington dc is a resort hotel for instance.
# They might all be some identifiers for special places that will probably have nothing to do with agriculture.
# So we will just throw them away.

# For the remaining, we will divide them by 10, as specified in the Codebook.

# Additionally, we also need to correct the counties in ICPSR 08611 that do not match the FIPS code only by dividing by 10 
# they are all located in 52 which is Maryland 

table(df$`ICPSR STATE CODE`) # so we look for MARYLAND (1788)

# for the FIPS and ICPSR codes, to make them match properly

# In the condition of the first if:

# and we add the condition State = Maryland to avoid counties with same names but different state
# and Maryland because it is the state at stake here

# Since we have always one year over two for congressional data, we will simply use the value for each year 
# that we have to put it in the values for the year + 1. It will be the same for presidential data, but with 
# year t+1, t+2 and t+3.
